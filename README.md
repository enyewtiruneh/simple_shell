0x16. C - Simple Shell

This project is an implementation of a shell command executed interface created
as the team project for the C code programming.

This project consists of C program concepts to implement a shell interface command
execution that accepts user commands like other Unix OS and then executes each command in 
a separate process. This project might have some limitation comparing to the main Unix OS. 
Completing this project will involve using the UNIX fork(), exec(), wait(), getline() and pipe() 
system calls and can be completed on Linux system.

There are some Objectives according to the shell OS and C programming:
Unix Shell.
Unix Parent and Child Processes.
Unix Input and Output redirections.
Unix Pipe.
Unix fork(), exec(), wait(), open(), close(), dup(), and pipe() system calls.
Implement a Simple Shell Interface using Unix system calls.
